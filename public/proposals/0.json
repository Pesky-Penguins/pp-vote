    "The Pesky Penguins DAO (NootDAO) performs many duties crucial to the success of the Pesky Penguins project. In addition to moderating the Discord, NootDAO has been responsible for securing partnerships and sourcing alpha and mints, adding tremendous value to Pesky Penguins holders since 2021.",
    "All moderators, alpha hunters, and members of DAO Leadership have been working on a volunteer basis. The Pesky Penguins dev team believes that the functions performed by the DAO are essential to the continued success of the project, and believes the DAO should share in that success as well.",
    "The dev team proposes increasing Pesky Penguins royalties from 5% to 6%, directing 1% of every aftermarket sale to NootDAO's multi-sig wallet, where these funds will be used to ensure the ongoing health of the community and success of the project."
